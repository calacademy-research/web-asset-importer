# üß≠ CASIZ Extraction Workflow ‚Äì IZ Importer

This document describes the step-by-step **workflow used by the IZ Importer** to find CASIZ IDs from an image. The process follows a logical fallback strategy that attempts to extract CASIZ identifiers from various metadata sources like the filename, EXIF data, and directory name.

---

## üß± High-Level Structure

The CASIZ ID extraction starts from the top-level `get_casiz_ids` method and goes through the following stages:

---

## ‚úÖ Matching Success

At **any stage**, if a valid CASIZ number is extracted, it is stored in `self.casiz_numbers` and the workflow **short-circuits**, skipping the remaining steps.

---

## ‚ùå Matching Failure

If all three stages fail:
- `get_casiz_ids()` returns `False`
- No CASIZ ID is stored or associated with the image

---

## üß© Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. `get_casiz_ids(image_path)`

This is the main entry point for CASIZ extraction. It performs a **sequential attempt** to find CASIZ data from three potential sources by the following order:

- First it will look into the **image filename** (see 2.1)
- Then it will look into the **EXIF metadata** (see 2.2)
- Last it will look into the **directory name** (see 2.3)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**  
> The process stops immediately once a match is found in any step.  
> For example, **if CASIZ ID is found in the filename, the EXIF and directory steps are skipped.**

For each of the step above, IZ importer will try the same way to extract the casiz number (see section `CASIZ Extraction Rules` below)

---

### 2.1 üìÅ `attempt_filename_match`

This function checks whether the **base filename** contains any recognizable CASIZ patterns.

---

### 2.2. üßæ `get_casiz_from_exif`

If the filename match fails, this function tries to extract a CASIZ ID from the image's **EXIF metadata** (e.g., description or title fields).

It will try to extract casiz from the following fields: (see metadata repo for more details on those constant definitions)

| EXIF Tag |
|----------|
| EXIFConstants.IPTC_KEYWORDS |
| EXIFConstants.XMP_DC_SUBJECT |
| EXIFConstants.XMP_LR_HIERARCHICAL_SUBJECT |
| EXIFConstants.IPTC_CAPTION_ABSTRACT |
| EXIFConstants.XMP_DC_DESCRIPTION |
| EXIFConstants.EXIF_IFD0_IMAGE_DESCRIPTION |
| EXIFConstants.XMP_TITLE |

---

### 2.3 üìÇ `attempt_directory_match`

If both filename and EXIF methods fail, the importer attempts to extract CASIZ ID from the **directory path** containing the image.

---

## 3. üîé CASIZ Extraction Rules

‚úÖ Following pattern will be used to extrac CASIZ:

1. if there is `cas` or `casiz` (case insensitive) in the string **before** consecutive digits
   1. if digits are longer than 3: take up to 10 digits as CASIZ, otherwise go to next rule
   2. there can be other characters between the digits and `cas/casiz`, but not between the digits 
2. if consecutive digits is more than 5. take up to 10 digits as CASIZ
3. there can be more than 1 matches

---

### 3.2 single casiz match

‚úÖ Matches:
- Prefixed forms like:
  - cas_123
  - casiz_test_123
  - cas_abc_123456
  - cas_abc_1234
  - cas_x-1234
  - cas1234
- Unprefixed numeric strings:
  - 12345, 6789012 (within 5 to 10 digits)

‚ùå Does not match:
- Prefixes shorter than "cas" (e.g., "ca 125")
- Numbers with fewer than 3 digits after prefix (e.g., "cas 1")
- Standalone numbers with fewer than 5 digits (e.g., "12")
- Numbers without proper prefix format (e.g., "image123 _something-4444 file999")
